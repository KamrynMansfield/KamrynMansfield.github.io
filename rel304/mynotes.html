										<h1>My Personal Notes</h1>
									</header>
									<p>This page is focused on how studying the writings of Isaiah has strengthened my testimony of Jesus Christ. 
										It is a compilation of notes I took in class and reflections I have had 
										while creating this website. On this page, as well as the home page, you can also 
										download a pdf version of my class notes.

									<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<h3>Hesed</h3>
									<p> Jesus Christ is Jehova, and He want's to form a relatinoship with us. 
										From the beginning, Jehova has made covenants with God's children, and 
										those covenants help us to create a connection with God and Christ that we 
										couldn't have otherwise. Just like how having a relationship with someone you 
										love without being married to them is different, when we enter into a covenant with 
										God, we enjoy a special kind of love from God. Hesed is the Hebrew word for this special 
										kind of love, but there is no English equivalent. Hesed is often translated in the JKV 
										as loving kindness or mercy. 
									</p>
									<p>In Isaiah and throughout scripture, Jehova sometimes relates his relationship 
										with us to a marriage relationship or a family relatinoship. I think comparing 
										our relationship with Christ to a marriage relatinoship is really helpful. There 
										is just something different about making a commitment to each other through a 
										ceremony. 
									</p>

									<h3>Repentance</h3>
									<p>The Book of Isaiah is full of examples of how Christ will never forget us and 
										always help us come back to Him. Like with the Israelites, no matter how many 
										times we turn from God and follow our own will, Christ will always help 
										us come back to Him. Not only will He help us, but he is constantly preparing a way 
										for us to come back to Him. Like with Lehi's posterity. Even though they strayed 
										away from God for many years, God was preparing the Book of Mormon to bring them 
										back into His fold thousands of years later. Christ wants as many peopel to 
										return to Him as possible, but He won't force us to create a relationship with Him. 
										Forcing something is not the way to create the connected relatinoship that Christ wants 
										to have with us. 
									</p>

									<h3>Prohpecy</h3>
									<p>I have learned a lot about prophecy through this class. Isaiah prophesied to help 
										the Israelites of his time, but his prophecies also connected to events in the 
										future. Sometimes Isaiah meant to prophesy of future events like Christ and the 
										last days, but sometimes, he didn't intend to prophesy of the things we, as modern 
										christians, often think he did. Even if all of Isaiah's prophecies weren't 
										specifically targetted towards our day or Christ's day, we could still 
										liken them to us like Nephi did so often. The principles that can be learned 
										from Isaiah's prophecies are true principles that help us learn more about God and Jesus Christ. 
										Here are some principles that I have learned from Isaiah's prophecies.
									</p>
									<ul>God has our best interests in mind</ul>
									<ul>God knows more than us</ul>
									<ul>God keeps His promises</ul>
									<ul>God will use His covenant people to share the gospel</ul>
